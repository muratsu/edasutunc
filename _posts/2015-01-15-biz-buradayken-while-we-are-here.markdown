While We Are Here is a cinéma vérité documentary that I worked with two friends from university. We were trying to find answers to the questions that were bothering us about the events like Gezi and Kobani. The Gezi protests began in May 2013 to protest a plan to destroy a park in the center of the city but spread to issues like freedom of the press and the government’s attack on secularism. More than a year later Turkish police also used violence to break up a similar protest in the Validebag neigborhood. Kobani is a village on the Turkish-Syrian border where mostly Kurdish people live. As Kobani was attacked by ISIS the Turkish government prevented Kurdish people on the Turkish side of the border from crossing into Syria to defend their relatives.
