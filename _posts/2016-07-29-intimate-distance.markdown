Alte Schule Hohenstein Artist Residency, resided in Hohenstein, 50 kmâ€™s from the city of Nurnberg, in Bavaria region, a village of around 150 residents, was my first experience to live in a small village after residing in Istanbul for 23 years and in Chicago for almost 1 year. My one-month residency reminded me to slow down, being patient. Where the external stimulation is almost non-existent, I felt the inevitability of turning inwards, to confront my solitude and self. Spending much time in nature, I was able to examine my feelings, the feelings of distance from nature and the feeling of alienation.
