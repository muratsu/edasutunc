Sculptures made during artistsâ€™ residency in the small village of Hohenstein, expressing our alienation, explained in the way how we treat the natural environment. Rather than living the organismic or holistic character we treat nature as mere matter to be manipulated for human purposes and harming or interfering nature for our purposes in the name of development.
