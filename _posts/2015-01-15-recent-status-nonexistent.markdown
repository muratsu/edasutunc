This is a graphic design installation project I developed as a video.
I want the audience to feel the tension the participants of the Gezi ParkÄ± felt.
When someone enters the installation, they hear whispering. They hear whispering of people who did not have the courage to speak out loud: the media.
They find themselves alone with the names. Next to the names of the victims, there is an empty rope. I want the audience to ask themselves why this one rope is empty.


The victims of the Gezi Park protests included police officers, innocent bystanders, and a 14-year-old boy. In the face of state violence, anyone can become a victim.
