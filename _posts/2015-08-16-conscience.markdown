The conscience and the sensation of an artist does not have to consist within the commons in her country.

Self-censorship is an act that an artist does by classifiying own artwork in defendence to the sensibilities, preferences, beliefs of others.

Being born in Istanbul, Turkey the artist strives not to censor her artwork in any condition that may happen in topics that the government may find controversial.
