Heimat refers to a place towards which one has a strong feeling of belonging, and a deep-rooted fondness.

Crossing borders, time, cultures and memory serves as a foundation for understanding the self as a composite of identities.

Exploring the disjointed identities and ever-present search for home, the travelling suitcase exhibits multiple selves and investigates the search of a sense of a home.

In a permanent state of transit and self-transition, being a wanderer in this world; the travelling suitcase is currently exhibiting the past and current homes of the artist, until July 2016, which are subject to change as time passes.
