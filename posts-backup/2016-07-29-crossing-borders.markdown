The passport gives exclusive and universal control over the flow of humans across the planet. The passport is issued, owned and controlled by the nation state-it’s the primary identification card and the sole means of crossing borders internationally. It’s small and insignificant form belies the weight of abstract meaning held within. Each stamp, each unintelligible alphanumeric string of characters, each photograph is an issue of citizenship, migration, sovereignty, nationalism, nationhood a, belonging, identity, exclusion and inclusion. With this project I gave the participants the opportunity to create their own identities in a given situation- to enter my exhibition. They had the opportunity to create their own information, nationality etc. I created an activity book-like passport as a critic of the rules/laws created by adults, created identities and nationalities that cause world problems.
